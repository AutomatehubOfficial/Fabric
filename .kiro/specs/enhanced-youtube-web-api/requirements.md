# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances Fabric's existing YouTube transcript REST API to provide a comprehensive web-based interface for YouTube content extraction. The current API only supports basic transcript extraction, but users need access to comments, metadata, playlist support, and better error handling for building robust web applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want to extract YouTube video metadata through the API, so that I can display video information alongside transcripts in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a POST request to `/youtube/metadata` with a video URL THEN the system SHALL return video title, description, duration, view count, and publish date
2. WHEN the video URL is invalid THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error with descriptive message
3. WHEN the YouTube API key is not configured THEN the system SHALL return a 503 error with setup instructions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to extract YouTube video comments through the API, so that I can analyze audience engagement and sentiment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a POST request to `/youtube/comments` with a video URL THEN the system SHALL return up to 100 top-level comments
2. WHEN I specify a `maxResults` parameter THEN the system SHALL return that many comments (up to 100)
3. WHEN the video has comments disabled THEN the system SHALL return an empty array with appropriate message
4. WHEN the YouTube API key is not configured THEN the system SHALL return a 503 error with setup instructions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to extract all available YouTube content (transcript, comments, metadata) in a single API call, so that I can efficiently gather comprehensive video data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a POST request to `/youtube/extract` with content type flags THEN the system SHALL return requested data types in a single response
2. WHEN I specify `includeTranscript: true` THEN the response SHALL include transcript data
3. WHEN I specify `includeComments: true` THEN the response SHALL include comments data
4. WHEN I specify `includeMetadata: true` THEN the response SHALL include metadata
5. WHEN multiple content types are requested AND one fails THEN the system SHALL return partial data with error details for failed components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a web application developer, I want enhanced error handling and validation, so that I can provide better user feedback and handle edge cases gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send malformed JSON THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error with specific validation details
2. WHEN I send an unsupported URL format THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error with supported format examples
3. WHEN YouTube services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL return a 503 error with retry suggestions
4. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return a 429 error with retry-after header

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a playlist analyzer, I want to extract information from YouTube playlists through the API, so that I can process multiple videos efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a POST request to `/youtube/playlist` with a playlist URL THEN the system SHALL return metadata for all videos in the playlist
2. WHEN I specify `includeTranscripts: true` THEN the system SHALL include transcript data for each video
3. WHEN the playlist is private or unavailable THEN the system SHALL return a 403 error with appropriate message
4. WHEN processing large playlists THEN the system SHALL support pagination with `offset` and `limit` parameters

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a mobile app developer, I want CORS support and proper HTTP headers, so that I can call the YouTube API from browser-based applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I make a preflight OPTIONS request THEN the system SHALL return appropriate CORS headers
2. WHEN I make requests from different origins THEN the system SHALL allow cross-origin requests
3. WHEN responses are returned THEN they SHALL include proper Content-Type headers
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL include consistent error response format
